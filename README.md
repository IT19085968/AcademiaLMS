Project Description:
Purpose: You entered the nearest gas line as a car owner. You then log into the program and look for the gas station you entered. Then you click "Joined to queue," and if you want to leave without refueling, you click "Exit before pump fuel," otherwise, you select "Exit after pump fuel."
The number of people in the line per vehicle type should be visible when a different user comes in and searches for the nearest queue (for instance, the queue you entered).
Additionally, based on the fuel's arrival and completion state, shed owners can change the fuel status. All users ought to be able to see that status.

Technologies:
For the frontend: We used Android Studio,
For the credentials: SQLite,
For the database: MongoDB
